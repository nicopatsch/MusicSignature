# Music Signature

## What is this?

This project aims at showing the **repetition in music**. Select a song, and you will see, for each instrument playing in the song, the pattern that the notes create, the *signature* of the instrument. On a *signature*, each column and each rown corresponds to a note. When a pixel is lit up, it means that the two corresponding notes (the one of the row and the one of the column) are the same.

You can modify the *number of notes in a repetition* in order to select melodies that are longer or shorter. If you select 5, for instance, you will only see the notes that belong to a melody of 5 notes or more and that is repeted at least twice across the song.

## How do I use it?
